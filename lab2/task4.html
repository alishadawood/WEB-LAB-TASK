    <h1>Seasons</h1>
    <h2>Spring</h2>
    <p>Spring is a season of beauty, freshness, and renewal <br>that comes after the cold winter and before the hot <br> summer. During this time, the weather becomes mild<br> and pleasant, neither too cold nor too hot. Nature <br>awakens with new life—trees grow fresh green <br>leaves, flowers bloom in vibrant colors, and the air<br> feels cleaner and full of energy. Birds return from <br>migration, and animals come out of hibernation, filling <br>the environment with liveliness. .</p>
    <h2>Summer</h2>
    <p>Summer is the hottest season of the year. The days are long, the sun shines brightly, and people wear light clothes to stay cool. Children enjoy their summer holidays, and many like to travel, play, or eat ice cream and cold foods.</p>
<p>This season also brings delicious fruits like mangoes, melons, and watermelons. Although summer is full of fun and energy, it is important to drink plenty of water and stay safe from the strong heat.</p>
